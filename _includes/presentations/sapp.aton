	This presentation introduces numerical and visual techniques
	for analyzing structures in both written scores and musical
	performances.  These visualizations, known as "scape" plots,
	display both small- and large-scale features of the music
	and the transitions between them, much like a landscape
	painting captures the near (such as grass) to distant (such
	as sky) elements of a scene. The plots offer a more detailed
	understanding of musical structures and performance practices,
	connecting abstract musical concepts with their perceptual
	impact. Using these techniques expands our ability to analyze
	and appreciate the complexity of music across historical
	periods and performance traditions.

	Musical works composed within functional tonality are
	typically described as belonging to a specific key, such
	as "Sonata in C minor." However, this key designation
	typically reflects only the initial and often final key of
	a work or movement. Keyscapes, a specific type of scape
	plot for studying harmonic structure, reveal internal keys
	and illustrate how they relate to one another and their
	relative importance within a work. Keyscapes also offer a
	quick overview of key relationships between movements,
	particularly when they are in contrasting keys. These
	visualizations can summarize a composer's treatment of
	harmonic structure across a repertoire or genre, revealing
	patterns of key use over an extensive body of work. By
	presenting harmonic structures in a tangible and intuitive
	way, keyscapes offer valuable insights for both novices and
	experts.  They also highlight stylistic tendencies, such
	as the prominent use of the circle of fifths in the Baroque
	period, the more balanced harmonic approaches of the Classical
	period, and the expansion of harmonic complexity throughout
	the Romantic period, leading to a gradual dissolution of
	tonal structures in twentieth-century music.

	Scape plots can also be applied to various aspects of
	performances, particularly tempo and dynamics, providing
	insights into phrasing, accentuation, and stylistic differences
	between performers.  Scape plots of individual performances
	can highlight a performerâ€™s phrasing structure. They also
	enable comparisons between performance styles, measuring
	similarities between different interpretations of a work.
	This presentation will demonstrate how scape plots can be
	used to examine the duple and triple aspects of meter across
	performances of Chopin mazurkas by different pianists.  This
	presentation will also demonstrate how scape plots have
	been used to detect plagiarism in commercial recordings.
