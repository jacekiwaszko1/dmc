	Sometime between 1520 and 1530, a new aesthetic paradigm
	for European art music took hold on the Italian peninsula.
	Although simple enough to describe in general terms, scholars
	have long been unsure exactly how, when, and where these
	stylistic changes occurred, owing to limited information
	about composer biographies and a fuzzy understanding of
	seminal musical sources from the 1520s. At the same time,
	more music survives from this decade than any individual
	scholar can hope to control. The result has been that
	historians have told an oversimplified story prioritizing
	the major composers of the early sixteenth century, or those
	of the mid sixteenth century, at the expense of those in
	between.

	My 1520s Project aims to meet this challenge by making
	available more than 400 scores ca. 1510–40 and enabling me
	to undertake corpus analyses and data visualizations to
	capture the shift in musical texture. In my presentation,
	I focus on an emerging preference for thicker textures.
	This trend is first apparent in works from the 1510s such
	as Adrian Willaert’s <i>Verbum bonum</i> and Costanzo Festa’s
	<i>Tribus miraculis</i>, and it comes to dominate
	sixteenth-century musical style. My corpus allows me to
	establish a set of newly identified characteristics that
	set the “sonically saturated” music of the 1520s apart from
	the contrastive aesthetic preferred by the generation of
	composers surrounding Josquin des Prez. I show how
	historians—struggling to date manuscript sources—have
	errantly suggested that pervasive imitation emerged long
	before the technique actually became prevalent, in the years
	leading up to 1530.

	The 1520s Project challenges the ways in which scholars
	engage with the music of the Renaissance. Too often,
	sixteenth-century specialists—understandably overwhelmed
	by the sheer quantity of music that survives—lose sight of
	the forest for the trees. As a result, they develop ill-fitting
	historiographical paradigms, establish musical terminology
	hyper-focused on just a fraction of the repertory, or turn
	away from musical aesthetics altogether. The 1520s Project
	offers a model for analysis that uses a corpus to draw
	conclusions far more in line with the historical record.
