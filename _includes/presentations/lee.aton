@title: Tone-Melody Correspondence and Melodic Regression 
	in Cantonese Popular Music: Evidence from a Corpus Study

@abstract: 

	Cantonese, as a tonal language, relies on pitch variations
	to convey differences in word meaning.  In songs written
	in a tone language, song melody and linguistic tones should
	ideally correspond with each other to maintain the
	intelligibility of the lyrics. Music and language scholars
	have examined the topic of tone-melody correspondence across
	many cultures and genres, including Cantonese popular music
	(also known as Cantopop). However, prior studies on tone-melody
	correspondence in Cantopop been limited by small sample
	sizes and a lack of robust empirical evidence (Chan 1987;
	Wong and Diehl 2002; Ho 2010; Kirby 2022). Consequently,
	their findings provide only a partial understanding of
	Cantopop's text-setting practices. In this study, by applying
	a more rigorous methodology, I revisit claims and observations
	on tone-melody correspondence in Cantopop.

	This study makes two key contributions. First, I have
	constructed a corpus of 105 Cantopop songs released between
	2000 and 2020. In the Humdrum format created by David Huron,
	I transcribed each song’s melodic, textual, and phonetic
	features. The size of this sample is much larger than those
	used in previous studies, and the selection criteria for
	the songs are clearly defined to ensure the representativeness
	of the corpus. Furthermore, the dataset is publicly available,
	providing an invaluable resource for future research on
	Cantopop.

	Second, based on data from my corpus, I re-evaluate existing
	theories of tone-melody correspondence in Cantopop.  While
	previous studies have focused on the correlation between
	the direction of song melodies (i.e., upward, level, or
	downward) and the choice of tones in Cantopop text-setting,
	I introduce a new dimension by examining the influence of
	pitch register.  Drawing on Huron’s (2006) concept of
	“melodic regression,” I demonstrate that pitch register
	significantly correlates with both melodic direction and
	tone choice. Specifically, my analysis shows that notes in
	the higher register tend to follow a descending melody and
	are often paired with Cantonese tones of higher spoken
	pitch, and vice versa. In addition, melodic regression also
	explains the correlation between tone patterns and melodic
	directions in Cantopop.

	In sum, this study offers a new, larger, and more representative
	corpus of and sheds light on previously underexplored aspects
	of tone-melody correspondence and melodic regression in the
	genre. My findings and the dataset provide a strong foundation
	for future research on Cantopop and related topics.
