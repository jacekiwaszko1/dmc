	To begin pessimistically: from one perspective it would be
	reasonable to argue that as of late 2024, digital tools for
	the analysis of notated musical repertories have reached a
	plateau.  To be sure, projects from Palo Alto to Poland
	have succeeded in encoding large amounts of music and making
	these repertories widely available. Sophisticated search
	functionality has been developed. Analysis and visualization
	tools have facilitated greater access than ever before. For
	all of this, we have not yet reached a point where digital
	resources are leading us to fundamentally new interpretations.
	We have not yet reached a point where computers are regularly
	teaching us things about the music that we could not have
	figured out from old-fashioned reading, listening, and
	performing. And we have not yet reached a point where digital
	projects are supplying us with new questions. Over the next
	couple of decades it will be important to keep asking: can
	we get there?

	For now, digital search and analysis tools are useful above
	all for deepening our engagement with music we already know.
	This is not a trivial benefit. It is now possible to generate
	important insights by homing in on sometimes microscopic
	musical features—features that it would be possible to
	control in an analog way, but only if one were willing to
	devote a day or even a month to the task. Using resources
	like The Josquin Research Project and The 1520s Project,
	it is now possible to conduct a search that can add evidentiary
	weight to one’s intuitions about a given melodic motive;
	to peruse analyses of rhythm to see whether a given pattern
	is extremely rare or relatively common; and to study range
	histograms in order to better understand how composers
	manipulate tonal space.

	This presentation highlights cases in which digital tools
	have enhanced or concretized insights that initially emerged
	through old-fashioned engagement with musical texts and
	recordings. In Johannes Regis’s five-voice motet <i>Lux
	solempnis/Repleti sunt</i>, for instance, the voice-by-voice
	activity plot made available by the Josquin Research Project
	elucidates via a simple graphical display a textural
	disposition that would be hard to describe in words with
	anywhere near the same degree of efficiency. And in settings
	of the <i>Pater noster</i> prayer by Jean Richafort, Josquin
	des Prez, and Adrian Willaert, plots showing cumulative
	note attacks transform fairly impressionistic thoughts about
	textural density into precise observations. In all of these
	cases, digital tools are just that—tools for taking our
	knowledge of the music’s inner-workings further. When we
	apply these tools rigorously, we can come to know aspects
	of the music better even than musicians of the time did.
	Provided we use digital resources responsibly, that is,
	they have the potential to measurably increase our musical
	understanding.
